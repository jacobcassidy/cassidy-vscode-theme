# Cassidy Dark Theme

Cassidy Dark is a clean, modern Visual Studio Code theme originally inspired by the Monokai color palette.

The theme was designed with pure shades of gray for the workbench so the syntax color highlighting pops with no bias towards any single color.

## Includes Missing CSS & SCSS Syntax Grammar

VSCode does not update syntax grammar often. Cassidy Dark theme updates the CSS and SCSS grammar to include syntax highlighting for modern features.

Added are:
- `:is()` and `:where()` tokens for both CSS and SCSS.
- `,` comma token for SCSS.
- `>>`, `>`, `+`, `~` keyword operator combinator tokens for SCSS.
- `content`, `cursor`, `filter`, `font`, and `mask` property names tokens for SCSS.
