# Cassidy Dark Theme

Cassidy Dark is a clean, modern Visual Studio Code theme originally inspired by the Monokai color palette.

The theme was designed with pure shades of gray for the workbench so the syntax color highlighting pops with no bias towards any single color.

## Installation

The theme is currently in beta. Once version 1.0 is reached, I'll publish the theme for free in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace for easy downloading.

For now, you'll have to manually install the theme if you'd like to use it by cloning this repository into `~/.vscode/extensions` and restarting the editor.
